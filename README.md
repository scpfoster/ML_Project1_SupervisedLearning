# ML_Project1_SupervisedLearning
## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML
Project 1 in support of Udacity Intro to Machine Learning Nanodegree.  The focus is to use Supervised Learning Techniques.

### This repository is a Work In Progress ###
1. Project Start date: 5 May 2020
2. Project First Submission date: 10 May 2020
3. Project Second Submission date: 11 May 2020

When completed this project will contain all the files and data used to complete the first project in the nanodegree.

### Install
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

### Code

Template code is provided in the `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `census.csv` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in `visuals.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

Two image files are included that are used in the notebook.  The files are `Project1_ModelCompare.png` and `SGDC_explain.png`.

While the code in `visuuals.py` was not intended to be modified, I did modify one of the methods to address a warning with tight_layout.  I used a differnt approach to address how the subplots were being spaced.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
